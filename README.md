### Course Description

Data has always been used as a way to measure and improve processes in
business. At its core, this course intends to teach best practices for
optimizing business processes using data. During the course we will
discuss the following topics.

-   The ideal state of information flow within a business.
-   Required competencies for analytics staff.
-   Data warehouse functional requirements.
-   Possible analytics organization structures.
-   Data quality, data quality, and more data quality.

This course also includes a set of hands-on labs intended to walk
students through the process of providing analytics to a business. The
intent is not to get any deep skills in one particular area but to
introduce students to various technologies and to gain a small amount of
hands-on experience with those technologies. A very small amount of
coding will be required, help will be provided when necessary. This
semester we will be using the following technologies (in some form or
another).

-   GitHub
-   Domo
-   AWS
-   R/R Studio

All technologies exist in the cloud, however, some software downloads
may be necessary on occasion to interact with them.

### Learning Objectives

Objectives are as follows.

-   Introduce a set of ideal situations to optimize business operations
    through analytics.
-   Gain some hands-on experience with modern analytics technologies.

### Disability Accommodation

The University of Utah seeks to provide equal access to its programs,
services and activities for people with disabilities. If you will need
accommodations in the class, reasonable prior notice needs to be given
to the Center for Disability Services, 162 Union Building, 581-5020
(V/TDD). CDS will work with you and the instructor to make arrangements
for accommodations.

### General Guidelines on Academic Misconduct

These guidelines are not comprehensive. Rather, they reflect the most
common misconceptions that students have with respect to academic
misconduct: Never share a file with another student. If two or more
students collaborate on an effort, the outputs should either be:
Allocated to a single student. All other students must reproduce the
outputs independently. Destroyed. All students must reproduce the
outputs independently. When helping another student, never show them
your solution. Consider, working on their computer/whiteboard/paper
instead. If the student copies your solution manually by examining your
solution, you will be equally responsible for the given academic
misconduct. If a submission is not indicated as “group-based”, assume
that you need to complete the submission independently. If
group/independent nature of a submission is unclear, check with the
instructor before making the assumption. A busy schedule is not a
rationale for submitting all/part of someone else’s work as your own. If
you are responsible for unethical behavior in an academic misconduct
case, be truthful and forthcoming with information for the instructor
and/or university administrators involved. The typical sanction for a
first-time academic misconduct case is a grade of -100% for the
submission item. In addition, your details will be entered into a
centralized database so administrators can manage repeat offenders.

### Statement of Professional and Ethical Conduct

Because of the importance of professional and ethical behavior in
business, and its emphasis in our program, professional or academic
misconduct is not tolerated in the David Eccles School of Business.
Students are expected to adhere to the standards of behavior outlined in
the University of Utah Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities
(Policy 6-400). Students engaging in behavioral misconduct could be
subject to suspension or dismissal from the University. Students
involved in any form of academic misconduct, including but not limited
to cheating on tests, plagiarism and collusion may, at the instructor’s
discretion, receive a failing grade in the course, examination, or
academic assignment. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the
instructor may refer the case to the Student Behavior Committee for
hearing. If the instructor chooses not to do so, the Associate Dean for
Academic Affairs, after appropriate investigation, may do so along with
a recommendation to dismiss the student from the Business School. If,
after hearing the evidence, the Committee determines that the student in
question is guilty of the misconduct charged, the Committee may impose
sanctions in addition to those taken by the professor. If the academic
dishonesty is not proven, the instructor must rescind any sanctions
imposed and will be required to evaluate the student’s performance with
the assumption that there has been no misconduct. The School will treat
the student likewise. If a student suspects another student of academic
misconduct, he/she should refer the incident to the instructor, the
appropriate department, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, or the
Student Behavior Committee, administered by the Associate Dean of
Students, 270 Union.

### University Safety Statement

The University of Utah values the safety of all campus community
members. To report suspicious activity or to request a courtesy escort,
call campus police at 801-585-COPS (801-585-2677). You will receive
important emergency alerts and safety messages regarding campus safety
via text message. For more information regarding safety and to view
available training resources, including helpful videos, visit
safeu.utah.edu.

### Addressing Sexual Misconduct

Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and
gender (which Includes sexual orientation and gender
identity/expression) is a civil rights offense subject to the same kinds
of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses
against other protected categories such as race, national origin, color,
religion, age, status as a person with a disability, veteran’s status or
genetic information. If you or someone you know has been harassed or
assaulted, you are encouraged to report it to the Title IX Coordinator
in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 135 Park
Building, 801-581-8365, or the Office of the Dean of Students, 270 Union
Building, 801-581-7066. For support and confidential consultation,
contact the Center for Student Wellness, 426 SSB, 801-581-7776. To
report to the police, contact the Department of Public Safety,
801-585-2677(COPS).

### Undocumented Student Support Statement

Immigration is a complex phenomenon with broad impact—those who are
directly affected by it, as well as those who are indirectly affected by
their relationships with family members, friends, and loved ones. If
your immigration status presents obstacles to engaging in specific
activities or fulfilling specific course criteria, confidential
arrangements may be requested from the Dream Center. Arrangements with
the Dream Center will not jeopardize your student status, your financial
aid, or any other part of your residence. The Dream Center offers a wide
range of resources to support undocumented students (with and without
DACA) as well as students from mixed-status families. To learn more,
please contact the Dream Center at 801.213.3697 or visit dream.utah.edu.

### Statement of Grading Policy

Grading provides feedback to students on how well they have mastered the
content and learning objectives of a particular course to allow students
to capitalize on strengths and work to improve weaknesses through future
courses of action. The DESB grading policy is intended to ensure grades
offer reliable feedback regarding student performance, and to ensure
fairness and consistency across the School. The faculty member is
responsible for arriving at a grade for each student that the faculty
member believes appropriately reflects the student’s mastery of the
course material and learning objectives. The faculty member will then
consider the class’ overall performance in terms of School guidelines.
These guidelines are provided to ensure that grading, on average for the
School as a whole, is sustained at a reasonable level over time. The
guidelines are as follows:

If students have a concern about their grade in a particular course,
they should consider whether it reflects an accurate evaluation of their
mastery of the course material and learning objectives, in terms of the
above descriptors. If they need clarification of the instructor’s
evaluation, they should meet with the instructor to obtain additional
information and feedback. If after doing so, they believe their grade
was arrived at in an inappropriate manner, they may pursue an appeal
through the School’s appeals process as described in Section 5.15 of the
University of Utah Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (Policy
6-400).

### Use of Electronic Devices in Exams

Use of any and all electronic devices (e.g. pagers, cell phones,
language translators, laptops, tablets, calculators, etc.) is forbidden
during an exam unless otherwise specifically authorized by the
instructor. A student who uses an unauthorized device may be subject to
penalties for academic misconduct.
